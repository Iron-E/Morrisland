### Tax Calculator 2: The Audit
A remake of my first project, [Tax Calculator (TM)](https://github.com/ajzett/Tax-Calculator-TM-) using Gilbo-API. Written to showcase the `battle_manager`, it features multi-staged combat, multiple weapons, and optional dialogue. Reduced from 1,310 lines of code to 531.

### Roleplay
A demo written by RavenJSnow to showcase the map, NPC, and quest management systems.
