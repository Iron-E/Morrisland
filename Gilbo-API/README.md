### Locations
The location manager defaults to working with Numpy-array-based maps and works by increasing or decreasing the player's "position" on said map, which triggers a function that reads what is on that tile. However, it can be easily modified to use other 2D, or even 3D libraries to manage a location. See [documentation](https://github.com/ajzett/Gilbo-API/blob/master/DOCUMENTATION.md) for more. 

- [x] Location manager loads in and empties location data automatically
- [x] Location manager feeds data to Save & Load data to the save and load functions so your character can start in the same place

### LAN Battle?
- [ ] Battle other players over LAN. Not really sure about this one.
